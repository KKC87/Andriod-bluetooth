Android Bluetooth Sample
This sample demonstrates how to use the Bluetooth LE Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) to transmit arbitrary data between devices.

Introduction

This sample shows a list of available Bluetooth LE devices and provides an interface to connect, display data and display GATT services and characteristics supported by the devices.

It creates a Service for managing connection and data communication with a GATT server hosted on a given Bluetooth LE device.

The Activities communicate with the Service, which in turn interacts with the Bluetooth LE API.
